<strong>FILES WORKED ON: gitlet/Repository.java, gitlet/Main.java, gitlet/Commit.java</strong>

Gitlet is a version control system written in java that mimics some of the basic features of the popular Git system. It allows you to save the contents of entire 
directories of files through commits. You can also restore versions of files, view your backup history through a log, create branches, and merge branches 
together.
